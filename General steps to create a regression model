Data Preparation: Preprocess the data, check for missing values, and normalize the numerical features.

Feature Selection: Identify the most important features that affect the compressive strength of cement. You can use techniques such as correlation analysis or feature importance.

Split the Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Selection: Choose a suitable regression model for the problem. You can try different regression models such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, or Support Vector Regression.

Model Training: Train the selected regression model on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared.

Model Tuning: Fine-tune the model by tweaking hyperparameters, changing the model structure, or adding new features.

Model Deployment: Deploy the model to make predictions on new data.
